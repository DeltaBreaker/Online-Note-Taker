# Online Note Taker
This is a simple website deployed to Heroku for users to take and save notes online. Notes will save and persist across instances for ease of access and can easily be added/deleted on a whim. You can enter note information on the right, and when saved, they will appear on the left. Clicking on a note will bring the note information up on the right to view.

## Details
This application was built with Express and Node.js to manage the server side of things. The client is built in standard HTML/CSS/JS to be run in the browser. A uuid is given to each note object to keep track of which notes are which, which helps with deleting notes.
